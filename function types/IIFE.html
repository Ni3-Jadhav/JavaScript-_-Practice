    /*
        It is a JavaScript design pattern where a function is defined and executed immediately after 
        its creation. This pattern is often used to create a private scope for variables and avoid polluting 
        the global scope.
        IFE is useful for encapsulating code and preventing variable name conflicts in the global scope.
         It's commonly used in scenarios where you want to create a block of code that doesn't leave behind any 
         variables in the global scope.
