           set timeout is the Asynchronus,it  doesn't pause the execution of the rest of your code. It schedules the provided 
           function to be executed after the specified delay.
           If you need to perform some action after the timeout, you can place that code inside the callback function.
           setTimeout(callback, delay, arg1, arg2, ...); thes is the way of writting

            callback: A function to be executed after the specified delay.
            delay: The time (in milliseconds) to wait before executing the callback.
            arg1, arg2, ...: Optional arguments that can be passed to the callback function.
